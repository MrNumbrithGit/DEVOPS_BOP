Step-by-Step Installation on Ubuntu
1. Update System Packages
bash
Copy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
2. Install Required Dependencies
You’ll need wget, tar, and PostgreSQL:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt install -y wget tar postgresql postgresql-contrib
3. Download Semaphore
Go to the Semaphore GitHub releases page to get the latest release link. Replace the version number if there’s a newer one.

bash
Copy code
wget https://github.com/ansible-semaphore/semaphore/releases/download/v2.9.76/semaphore_2.9.76_linux_amd64.tar.gz
4. Extract the Semaphore Archive
bash
Copy code
tar -xvf semaphore_2.9.76_linux_amd64.tar.gz
5. Move the Semaphore Binary
bash
Copy code
sudo mv semaphore /usr/local/bin/
6. Create a PostgreSQL Database for Semaphore
Switch to the PostgreSQL user and create a new database and user for Semaphore:

bash
Copy code
sudo -i -u postgres
Within the PostgreSQL shell:

sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE semaphore;
CREATE USER semaphore WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'your_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE semaphore TO semaphore;
\q
Replace 'your_password' with a strong password of your choice.

7. Create the Semaphore Configuration File
Create a configuration file semaphore.ini:

bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/semaphore/semaphore.ini
Add the following content, adjusting the password field to match the one you set in the PostgreSQL step:

ini
Copy code
[database]
type = "postgres"
host = "localhost"
port = 5432
user = "semaphore"
password = "your_password"
dbname = "semaphore"
Save and close the file (Ctrl + X, then Y, then Enter).

8. Initialize the Semaphore Database
bash
Copy code
semaphore -config=/etc/semaphore/semaphore.ini db init
9. Run Semaphore
To start Semaphore, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
semaphore -config=/etc/semaphore/semaphore.ini server
10. Access Semaphore Web Interface
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080 to access the Semaphore web interface.

11. Setup Initial Admin User
Follow the on-screen instructions to set up the initial admin user and configure Semaphore.

Optional: Running Semaphore as a System Service
If you want Semaphore to run as a service, you can create a systemd service file.

Create a Service File
bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/semaphore.service
Add the Following Configuration
ini
Copy code
[Unit]
Description=Semaphore Service
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/semaphore -config=/etc/semaphore/semaphore.ini server
Restart=on-failure
User=nobody
Group=nogroup

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
Reload Systemd and Start Semaphore
bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start semaphore
sudo systemctl enable semaphore
Now Semaphore should start automatically on boot and be managed as a system service.

Troubleshooting
Check Logs: If Semaphore is not running correctly, check the logs for errors.
bash
Copy code
sudo journalctl -u semaphore
Database Connection Issues: Ensure PostgreSQL is running and accessible.
This guide should help you get Semaphore installed and running on Ubuntu. Let me know if you have any questions or run into issues!

To access the Semaphore web GUI after installing and running Semaphore, follow these steps:

Accessing Semaphore Web GUI
Ensure Semaphore is Running

Make sure Semaphore is running. You can start Semaphore using the command:

bash
Copy code
semaphore -config=/etc/semaphore/semaphore.ini server
If you have set it up as a system service, you can check its status with:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl status semaphore
Open a Web Browser

Open your preferred web browser.

Navigate to Semaphore Web Interface

Enter the following URL in the address bar:

plaintext
Copy code
http://localhost:8080
If you're accessing it from a different machine or server, replace localhost with the IP address or hostname of the machine where Semaphore is installed. For example:

plaintext
Copy code
http://<your-server-ip>:8080
Login or Setup Initial Admin User

Initial Setup: If this is your first time accessing Semaphore, you will need to complete the initial setup. Follow the on-screen instructions to set up the initial admin user.
Login: If you have already set up the admin user, log in with the credentials you created during the setup process.
Troubleshooting
Port Accessibility: Ensure that port 8080 is open and not blocked by any firewall. You can check if Semaphore is listening on port 8080 with:

bash
Copy code
sudo netstat -tuln | grep 8080
or

bash
Copy code
sudo ss -tuln | grep 8080
Check Logs: If you can't access the web interface, check the logs for any errors. If running as a systemd service, view logs with:

bash
Copy code
sudo journalctl -u semaphore
Database Connection: Ensure that Semaphore is able to connect to your database. Verify that your semaphore.ini file has the correct database credentials and that PostgreSQL is running.

Browser Issues: Clear your browser cache or try accessing the interface from a different browser or device to rule out any local browser issues.
