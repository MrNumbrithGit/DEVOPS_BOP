Docker Image: A lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software,
 including the code, libraries, dependencies, and runtime environment.

Docker Container: An isolated and portable runtime environment that contains all the dependencies and configurations necessary
 to run a piece of software, based on a Docker image.

Docker Registry: A centralized repository for storing and sharing Docker images, which can be either public or private.

Dockerfile: A text file that contains a set of instructions for building a Docker image, including the base image, dependencies,
 environment variables, and other configuration options.

Docker Compose: A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications, allowing users to specify the configuration
 and dependencies of all the services that make up an application in a single file.

Docker Swarm: A native clustering and orchestration tool for Docker, which allows users to deploy and manage a group of Docker 
hosts as a single virtual system.

Docker Volume: A persistent data storage mechanism for Docker containers, allowing data to be stored outside the container and 
be shared across multiple containers.

Docker Network: A virtual network that allows Docker containers to communicate with each other, either within a single Docker 
host or across multiple hosts in a distributed system.

Docker Image: To build a Docker image for a simple Python web app, you can create a Dockerfile with the following content:


FROM python:3
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
CMD ["python", "app.py"]

Then, run the following command to build the Docker image:

docker build -t my-python-app .


Docker Container: To run a container based on the Docker image we built in the previous example, you can use the following command:

docker run -d -p 5000:5000 my-python-app

This will start a container running the Python web app on port 5000, which can be accessed through a web browser or curl.

Docker Registry: To push the Docker image we built to a Docker registry, you can use the following command:

docker push my-registry/my-python-app

This will push the image to the Docker registry at the repository my-registry with the name my-python-app.

Dockerfile: The example in point 1 shows how to create a Dockerfile for building a Python web app image.

Docker Compose: To define a multi-container application using Docker Compose, you can create a docker-compose.yml file with the following content:

yaml

version: '3'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
  redis:
    image: "redis:alpine"
	
This defines two services: a web service based on the current directory (where the Dockerfile is) and a Redis service based on the Redis Alpine image. Then, run the following command to start the application:


docker-compose up

This will start both services and link them together so that the web service can communicate with the Redis service.

Docker Swarm: To create a Docker Swarm cluster, you can run the following command on the manager node:

docker swarm init

This will initialize the Swarm mode and create a new Swarm cluster with the current node as the manager. Then, you can join worker nodes to the cluster by running the following command on each worker node:


docker swarm join --token <token> <manager-node-ip>

This will join the worker node to the Swarm cluster and allow it to run services.

Docker Volume: To create a Docker volume, you can use the following command:

docker volume create my-data

This will create a new Docker volume with the name my-data. Then, you can mount this volume to a container by running the following command:

TRADITIONAL DEPLOYMENT:
Software is installed directly on physical servers.

VIRTUALIZED DEPLOYMENT:
Multiple virtual machines (VMs) run on a single physical server.

CONTAINER DEPLOYMENT:
Applications are packaged in lightweight, portable containers that can be easily moved between environments and orchestrated for automation and scaling.
