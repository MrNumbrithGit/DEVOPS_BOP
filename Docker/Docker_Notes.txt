Docker Image: A lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software,
 including the code, libraries, dependencies, and runtime environment.

Docker Container: An isolated and portable runtime environment that contains all the dependencies and configurations necessary
 to run a piece of software, based on a Docker image.

Docker Registry: A centralized repository for storing and sharing Docker images, which can be either public or private.

Dockerfile: A text file that contains a set of instructions for building a Docker image, including the base image, dependencies,
 environment variables, and other configuration options.

Docker Compose: A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications, allowing users to specify the configuration
 and dependencies of all the services that make up an application in a single file.

Docker Swarm: A native clustering and orchestration tool for Docker, which allows users to deploy and manage a group of Docker 
hosts as a single virtual system.

Docker Volume: A persistent data storage mechanism for Docker containers, allowing data to be stored outside the container and 
be shared across multiple containers.

Docker Network: A virtual network that allows Docker containers to communicate with each other, either within a single Docker 
host or across multiple hosts in a distributed system.

================================================================================================================================

Docker Image: To build a Docker image for a simple Python web app, you can create a Dockerfile with the following content:


FROM python:3
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
CMD ["python", "app.py"]

Then, run the following command to build the Docker image:

docker build -t my-python-app .


Docker Container: To run a container based on the Docker image we built in the previous example, you can use the following command:

docker run -d -p 5000:5000 my-python-app

This will start a container running the Python web app on port 5000, which can be accessed through a web browser or curl.

Docker Registry: To push the Docker image we built to a Docker registry, you can use the following command:

docker push my-registry/my-python-app

This will push the image to the Docker registry at the repository my-registry with the name my-python-app.

Dockerfile: The example in point 1 shows how to create a Dockerfile for building a Python web app image.

Docker Compose: To define a multi-container application using Docker Compose, you can create a docker-compose.yml file with the following content:

yaml

version: '3'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
  redis:
    image: "redis:alpine"
	
This defines two services: a web service based on the current directory (where the Dockerfile is) and a Redis service based on the Redis Alpine image. Then, run the following command to start the application:


docker-compose up

This will start both services and link them together so that the web service can communicate with the Redis service.

Docker Swarm: To create a Docker Swarm cluster, you can run the following command on the manager node:

docker swarm init

This will initialize the Swarm mode and create a new Swarm cluster with the current node as the manager. Then, you can join worker nodes to the cluster by running the following command on each worker node:


docker swarm join --token <token> <manager-node-ip>

This will join the worker node to the Swarm cluster and allow it to run services.

Docker Volume: To create a Docker volume, you can use the following command:

docker volume create my-data

This will create a new Docker volume with the name my-data. Then, you can mount this volume to a container by running the following command:

BEFORE DOCKER 

TRADITIONAL DEPLOYMENT:
Software is installed directly on physical servers.

VIRTUALIZED DEPLOYMENT:
Multiple virtual machines (VMs) run on a single physical server.

CONTAINER DEPLOYMENT:
Applications are packaged in lightweight, portable containers that can be easily moved between environments and orchestrated for automation and scaling.

================================================================================================================================

Portability: Containers are lightweight and portable, making it easy to move them between environments and deploy them on different infrastructures without modification.

Isolation: Containers provide a high level of application isolation, so issues with one container are less likely to impact others running on the same host.

Efficiency: Containers share the same operating system kernel, which reduces overhead and increases application density on a given host.

Scalability: Containers can be easily scaled up or down based on demand, and container orchestration tools like Kubernetes provide automated scaling.

Consistency: Containers provide a consistent environment for applications, regardless of where they are deployed.

DevOps: Containers enable DevOps practices like continuous integration and continuous delivery, making it easier to release and update applications quickly and frequently.

Security: Containers can be designed with security in mind, using techniques like image scanning and isolation to reduce the attack surface.

#In here the tag mean the VERSION.

docker pull nginx:1.20  

#Version speacified after ":"  (nginx:1.20)

docker run nginx  -> This will run in a interactive mode.

#This command will create a nginx container.

docker ps   ---> List the runnung containers.
docker ps -a --->List the runnung or stopped containers.

docker run --name BOP-websever -d nginx
# --name is a name that we can give
# -d is that which runs in the background.


docker rm Cid

#To stop a container

docker ps -qa  --> This will show only ID of all the running/stopped container.

docker stop $(docker ps -qa)  --> This will stop all the running containers.

docker rm $(docker stop $(docker ps -qa))  --> This will Stop all C , and removes all.

docker container prune
# This will remove all stopped containers.

docker rmi nginx
#To remove a perticular image.

Port Exposing

docker run --name some-nginx-port -d -p 8080:80 nginx

8080:80
Machine port:Container port
# This says ,Whenever you get a request port 8080 send that to 80.

0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp, :::8080->80/tcp    --this means--> localhost:8080 ==> 80

curl localhost:8080  --> Will get you the page.

netstat -tunlp  --> This will show what port are used for what.

#To check the logs of a container,
docker logs dcb346b9eaca

=====================================

docker cp Try.txt dcb346b9eaca:/tmp
#To copy file onto container,  we can do ulta also

docker commit dcb346b9eaca  --> will create a new copy of the container.

docker create Cid  --> The "docker create" command is used to create a new container from an image, but it does not start the container.
 Instead, it returns a container ID that can be used later with the 
 
 """""""docker start"""""""command to start the container.


====================================================================================================================================================

"docker export" allows you to save a container's filesystem as a tar archive, which can be useful for sharing 

"docker import" allows you to create a new Docker image from a tar archive created by "docker export".

Overall, "docker export" and "docker import" are useful tools for managing Docker containers and images,
especially when it comes to sharing or backing up container data.

==========================================

docker kill --> force shutdown

docker stop --> Gives time finsih the process

==========================================

"docker save" allows you to save Docker images and their dependencies into a single tar archive, which can be useful 
for distributing or backing up your images.

"docker load" allows you to restore Docker images from a tar archive created by "docker save", which can be useful 
when you need to recreate a previous Docker environment or restore a backup of your Docker images.

==========================================

DOCKER VOLUME   (Used as ***BACKUP***)
#Using volumes, you can store and manage data separately from the container filesystem, 
making it easier to ***BACKUP***, migrate, and share data across multiple containers or hosts.

docker volume ls   --> to list all the volume 

#we can create a volume while you create a container,

docker run --name testVolume2 -v BackupVolumeTest:/temp -d nginx
                  name of con    volume name:/which folder 
#This is will create a volume.

DRIVER    VOLUME NAME
local     BackupVolumeTest

#Even though if you delete the container by miss ,
you can run the same command to retrive container with same backedup file

docker run --name testVolume2 -v BackupVolumeTest:/temp -d nginx

==========================================

VOLUME MOUNT

docker run --name testVolume2 -v  /home/mrnumbrith/DoCkEr_Examples:/temp -d nginx
												deamon folder   :  File in container
#In docker volume mount , We can sync the docker system file to container folder  


docker run --name testVolume2 -v  /home/mrnumbrith/DoCkEr_Examples:/temp -v /home/mrnumbrith/DoCkEr_Examples/docfolder:/  -d nginx
#Mount 2 folder at once ,multiple containers.

==========================================

DOCKER FILE

#To create a self made images rather than pulling from Docker hub.

FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update -y
RUN apt-get install git -y

Save the file as    "Dockerfile"

docker build -t nameofthecon .    --> this will search for Dockerfile named file in directory.

#NOTE : always have a empty folder.(as . will take a the files into considaration)

#When you want name to changed.

docker build -f pyname.txt .  --> With different name

#Image name can be used 

Docker build -t NameHere .

#NOTE : If you want to add anything new to dokcerfile ,add it at the end.As it depends on cache model.

docker build --no-cache .

#Multi stage dockerfile is used to reduce the image size.

A multi-stage Dockerfile is used to create Docker images that are optimized for size and performance.
It does this by breaking up the build process into multiple stages, each of which can be optimized for a specific task.
This helps to create a final Docker image that only includes what is needed to run the application, making it smaller and faster.
