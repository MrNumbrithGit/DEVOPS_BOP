# Teraform 
Terraform is a popular infrastructure as code (IaC) tool used in DevOps. Here are five points that explain what Terraform is and why it's used in DevOps:

Terraform automates infrastructure provisioning and management through defining infrastructure as code using a simple, declarative language.
Terraform is cloud-agnostic, supporting multiple cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform, enabling easy infrastructure management across 
different cloud environments.
Terraform code is just text files, allowing version control systems like Git to track changes and roll back if necessary, making it easy for teams to collaborate.
Terraform simplifies infrastructure management by allowing all infrastructure resources to be managed from a single tool, especially useful for complex infrastructure 
setups.
Terraform aligns with DevOps best practices such as Infrastructure as Code, version control, and CI/CD, facilitating better collaboration and faster delivery of 
infrastructure changes.
